When you insert a Masked Edit, you will be prompted with this dialog of options. Here we will go through what each one means.<br><br>

<b>Mask:</b> This is where you set the rules for your edit box. We will discuss how the mask works in the <a href='#mask'>Mask section</a>. The are four shortcut buttons below the mask setting that will insert the rule for a letter, a digit, a letter or digit, and a number (0 to 99) respectively. There is also a list of presets you can use.<br><br>

3D Look:</b> This will make the edit box look 3D instead of just a black border.<br><br>

<b>Hide on Start:</b> The edit box will be invisible at the start of the frame.<br><br>

<b>Automatically Adjust Case:</b> Edit masks are case sensitive, so if the mask wants an uppercase character and you enter a lowercase character, your entry is refused. However, if this option is on, letters will automatically adjust their case to fit the mask, if needed.<br><br>

<b>Non-Restrictive:</b> If this option is on, the user can type anything they want in the edit box, but when the <a href='getdata.html'>Get Data</a> expression is used, it will return only those characters that match the mask. Also, the Set Cell actions and the Get Cell/Get Token expressions will not work in this mode.<br><br>

<b>Number Scrolling:</b> When this option is on, and the edit cursor is in a number field, pressing up or down will scroll the number.<br><br>

<b>Number Wrapping:</b> If number scrolling is on and the user hits the lower or upper limit for a number field, normally the scrolling will stop. If this option is on, the number will wrap, i.e. go from the lowest to the highest number or vice versa.<br><br>

<b>Font:</b> Changes the font and text color.<br><br>

<b>Background:</b> Changes the background color.<br><br>

<a name=mask></a><b class='t'>Mask Syntax</b><br><br>

The mask is a set of rules that define how the edit box can be modified.<br><br>

<b>Plain Text</b><br>Any plain text in the mask is "static text." It cannot be edited. A mask of <pre>This is the mask</pre> will result in no modifiable characters.<br><br>

<b>[]</b><br>Square brackets designate one editable character. What is inside the brackets designates what characters can be typed in that field. A mask of <pre>[asdf]</pre> would have one cell in which the lowercase a, s, d, or f can be typed (masks are case-sensitive). If you wanted to allow any letter, that would be a pretty long mask, so instead you can use a dash (-) to designate ranges. A cell for any lowercase letter can be accomplished with the mask <pre>[a-z]</pre> Any of these can be combined. The mask <pre>[a-m7p-z169]</pre> would allow the lowercase letters a to m and p to z, as well as the digits 1, 6, 7, or 9.<br><br>

<b>{}</b><br>Curly braces designate one editable number. There are two methods of specifying the allowed numbers. The first is simply a mask like <pre>{50}</pre> which will allow numbers 0 to 50 (or whatever other number is used. You can also specify a range of numbers: <pre>{25-500}</pre> Negative numbers are not allowed. Note that one number cell will take up as many characters as the largest number has digits.<br><br>

<b>^ (caret)</b><br>A caret will simply repeat the last instruction, whether it was a character, number, or even static character.<br><br>

<b>\ (backslash)</b><br>A backslash is used as an escape character. You may want to use brackets, braces, or carets as static characters or editable characters and this will allow you to do that. The backslash can also escape itself. For example, the mask <pre>Hello \[ \] \{ \} \\ \^ \a \c</pre> will display an uneditable edit box with the following text: Hello [ ] { } \ ^ a c<br>Escaping regular letters and numbers will have no specific effect. In an editable character, dashes can also be escaped. The mask <pre>[a-z\-+\[\]]</pre> will have an editable character that allows any lowercase letter, a plus or a minus, and square brackets.<br><br>
