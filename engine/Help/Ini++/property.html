<h1>The Property Pane</h1>

<p>The following is a list of the options found in the properties pane for the Ini++ object.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Global Data is checked then this Ini++ object uses a global data 
store. The name of the global data store is specified by Global data 
key. All Ini++ objects which share the same data key share the same data.</li>
<li>Default File specifies the path of a file to load at the start of the frame. 
This can be a relative path. If Read Only is checked then this file is 
loaded in read-only mode.</li>
<li>Base Folders specifies the path that relative paths are relative to. This can be:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px">
– Windows Folder (e.g. C:\Windows)</br>
– (Initial) current folder. This can be changed by the user when the 
program is launched (for instance, if a short cut to the program 
is made it can be specified there). If the current folder changes 
during the frame, this path will not be changed.</br>
– The folder that the EXE is in. When the program is run from 
MMF, this will instead be the folder that the mfa file is saved in.</br>
– User Application Data (e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\Jax\Application Data)</br>
– Common Application Data (e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data)</br>
Note that in early versions of Windows the last two folders do not exist. 
In this case the Windows directory will be used.
</div>
<ul>
<li>Initial Data is some text as Ini data which is to be loaded after the 
default file is loaded. This should respect all the settings of the object 
except compression or encryption. That is, it should be uncompressed 
and unencrypted regardless of settings. There is a limit of 3000 characters.</li>
<li>If Enable ‘Auto Load’ is selected then the current file is reloaded from 
the disc every time it is read. It is not recommended you use this for it is slow.</li>
<li>If Enable ‘Auto Save’ is selected then the data is written to the current 
file every time it is changed. If you do not require this, it is best not to use it.</li>
<li>Checking the Create folders for files if they do not exist box means that 
if you try to save an Ini file to a path that does not exist, then the folder 
will be created for you automatically. This works recursively, too. If 
for some reason this is not what you want, just uncheck it.</li>
<li>If 1-based index is checked then all expressions which require a number 
(like Get Nth Group Name) will start at 1. Otherwise they will start at zero.</li>
<li>If you don’t want to worry about the rest of the settings, just check 
Use Standard Settings. Then the rest of the settings will work as you expect them to!</li>
</ul>

</br>
<p>If you have not checked Use Standard Settings then custom settings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Use Compression is checked, file are loaded and saved using compression.</li>
<li>If the Encryption box is checked, files are loaded and saved using encryption. 
The encryption key should be written in the box provided.</li>
<li>If the new line box is unchecked then the standard windows new line 
will be used. Otherwise the string input in the box will be used as the new line string.</li>
<li>Always quote strings determines if strings are always quoted or not in saved files.</li>
<li>Case sensitive determines if the Ini++ object is case sensitive or not. 
This affects loading and saving too.</li>
<li>If Allow empty groups is checked then the object can contain empty groups. 
Otherwise they are just deleted.</li>
<li>The use of Load and Save Subgroups is described in the Subgroups section of the Advanced Features.</li>
<li>The use of the Repeated groups, Repeated Items and Save repeated items 
as original settings are described in the Group and Item Repeats section of the Advanced Features.</li>
<li>The use of the Escape characters in group names, in item names and 
in item values options are described in the Escape Characters section of the Advanced Features.</li>
</ul>
