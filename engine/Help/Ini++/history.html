<h1>History</h1>

<p>In January 2003 I released my SuperINI class for Jamagic. This was a ‘better’ 
Ini class, compatible with the default Jamagic one. It featured compression 
and encryption, the ability to merge instances together, the ability to disable 
auto-save and keep the data in memory, the ability to list groups and items 
and the ability to test if a group or item exists. It was quite a simple little 
class but I used it so much since I made it. Nearly every Jamagic project I 
made since used the object in some way.</br>
</br>
Over the summer of 2006 I started to rewrite the class in C++. I quickly did 
this and added many more features that were not in the Jamagic version. I 
then started work on the Multimedia Fusion 1.5 extension for it. However, 
with university starting and a lack of motivation not much happened to it. In 
the mean time, I had upgraded to Multimedia Fusion 2 and Joshtek converted 
it to the MMF2 SDK for me. After fixing some initial porting problems (for 
instance, changes in how alterable values work), I started working properly 
on it again. The tedious task of making use of the properties pane and 
making the debugger were the main tasks.</br>
</br>
However, in each new update I added new features. Fueled by the ideas of 
Nova, it ended up doing just about everything! I wrote a new debugger, the 
tree-view debugger, and Joshtek suggested it be available during runtime. 
I loved that idea and used it. I then started using custom dialog boxes (a 
MMF2 feature) in order to make it simpler to use.</br>
</br>
The icon was the good work of dingdong. The object needed to be renamed 
though to start with ‘Ini’, so it would appear next to the regular Ini object 
on the extension list. Some suggestions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ini Pro</li>
<li>Ini Advanced</li>
<li>Ini Extreme</li>
<li>Ini+</li>
<li>Ini Amplified (It sort of rhymes...)</li>
</ul>
<p>We all quite liked ‘Ini+’ but there was already an extension with this name 
for ‘Click and Create’. So we just put another ‘+’ on the end, and then we 
had the name.</br>
</br>
A massive thanks goes to Yves for helping me many many times and also to 
OliverPearl who did an absolutely brilliant job of testing it.</br>
</br>
That story was not exactly interesting, but since when was the documentation 
supposed to be interesting?</p>
