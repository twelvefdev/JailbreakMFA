<p>The Associative Array Object works very much like a normal
array. The main difference is that an associative array uses
string indices (called keys) wheras a normal array uses numeric
indices. In a normal array, you might say, &quot;Get the value at
index 5.&quot; In an associative array, you might say, &quot;Get
the value at key 'Matt'.&quot; Another difference between normal
arrays and this Associative Array Object is that the Associative
Array Object stores both a value (that is, a number) and a string
at eack key. It does not create separate keys for strings and
values.<br>
<u>Addresses</u>: The Associative Array Object allows you to have
indirect access to locations in memory (that is, addresses of
data). You can use these addresses to access the elements in the
associative array without having to know the keys for the
elements. It also allows you to access and modify strings and
values without constantly having to search for keys. For big
associative arrays, using addresses is much more efficient. <strong>WARNING</strong>:
If you enter a bad address (some number you made up, the address
of key that you deleted, etc.), you run the risk of crashing your
application or otherwise mess things up, so <strong>be careful</strong>.
The only bad address that is safe to use is 0, which is returned
by the Associative Array Object in many situations.</p>

<p><a name="ver114"></a><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Upgrading
from Version 1.13 or Earlier</font></p>

<p>In earlier versions of this object, global objects and sub-applications
did not work together. You may have taken alternative measures.
The problems have been fixed in this version. The changes are
such that you may need to rework any applications that use global
Associative Arrays in sub-applications. For information, check
out the <em>Global Data and Sub-Applications</em> section.</p>

<p><a name="global"></a><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Global
Data</font></p>

<p>The Associative Array object's set-up dialog allows you to set
the object's data to be global. If you select this option, that
object will keep its data over frames. Exactly what data it will
keep:<br>
- All keys and their strings and values<br>
- Key found in the last 'Key Exists' condition<br>
- Last error code<br>
- File loading and saving intervals<br>
If you're loading or saving a file, have data set to be global,
and change frames, the object will immediately stop loading or
saving. The loading and saving will not be continued on the next
frame.</p>

<p>In order for an Associative Array object to keep data over
frames, the objects in both frames must:<br>
- Have the same name<br>
- Both be set as global<br>
There is a &quot;bug&quot; in MMF where names get truncated at
run-time if they're longer than 24 characters, so if you have say
&quot;Associative Array Object&quot; and &quot;Associative Array
Object 2&quot;, at run-time, both names will be the same because
the second one gets truncated to &quot;Associative Array Object&quot;.
This will cause problems with the global data.</p>

<p><a name="gdsa"></a><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Global Data
and Sub-Applications</font></p>

<p>An interesting question arises when one thinks about using
global data and sub-applications. What you tend to have are two
global objects (with the same name) existing simultaneously. How
should these two global objects interact? Well, in the
Associative Array object, two global objects existing
simultaneously share the same exact data. Changing a key in one,
modifies a key in the other. Loading a file in one, loads it in
the other. There are some quirks to be aware of when using two
simultaneous global Associative Array objects:<br>
- If an error occurs in an action or in a condition, the error is
only generated in the object in which the error occured. It <strong>is
not</strong> generated in the other global objects.</p>

<p><a name="conditions"></a><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Conditions</font></p>

<p><strong>Does a Certain Key Exist?</strong><br>
This condition returns true if the specified key is found in the
array.</p>

<p><strong>Do So Many Keys Starting With a Substring Exist?</strong><br>
This condition returns true if the specified number of keys exist
that start with the specified substring. The last key found is
the <em>n</em>th key starting wth the specified substring, where <em>n</em>
is the specified number of keys. For example, if you check for 3
keys, the third key found would be the last key found regardless
of how many keys there are that start with the substring.</p>

<p><strong>Do So Many Keys Ending With a Substring Exist?</strong><br>
This condition returns true if the specified number of keys exist
that end with the specified substring. The last key found is the <em>n</em>th
key ending wth the specified substring, where <em>n</em> is the
specified number of keys. For example, if you check for 3 keys,
the third key found would be the last key found regardless of how
many keys there are that end with the substring.</p>

<p><strong>Do So Many Keys Containing a Substring Exist?<br>
</strong>This condition returns true if the specified number of
keys exist that contain the specified substring. The last key
found is the <em>n</em>th key containing the specified substring,
where <em>n</em> is the specified number of keys. For example, if
you check for 3 keys, the third key found would be the last key
found regardless of how many keys there are that contain the
substring.</p>

<p><strong>Result of Last 'Key Exists' Condition</strong><br>
This condition will return the result of the last 'Key Exists'
condition. In other words, if the last search found a key, this
will return true. If not, it will return false.</p>

<p><strong>File is Loading</strong><br>
This condition returns true if a file is currently being loaded.</p>

<p><strong>File is Saving</strong><br>
This condition returns true if a file is currently being saved.</p>

<p><strong>File is Done Loading</strong><br>
This condition is a true event condition. That means that events
having this condition will be executed as soon as a file is
finished successfully being loaded.</p>

<p><strong>File is Done Saving?<br>
</strong>This condition is a true event condition. That means
that events having this condition will be executed as soon as a
file is finished successfully being saved.</p>

<p><strong>Has the Array Been Modified?</strong><br>
This condition returns true if the array has been modified since
the last time the a file was saved or loaded or since the last
time the array was cleared.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Array Empty?</strong><br>
This returns true if the array is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Has an Error Occured?</strong><br>
This condition is a true event condition. That means that events
having this condition will be executed as soon as an error is
encountered in an ACTION or CONDITION by the Associative Array
Object (and only when an error is encountered). It will return
true when the Error Number is greater than 0, which will always
be the case when an error is encountered. To check for errors in
expressions, use the Get the Current Expression Error Number
expression.</p>

<p><a name="actions"></a><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Actions</font></p>

<p><strong>Modify/Add a Value</strong><br>
This action will change the value at the specified key to the
specified value. If the key does not exist, it will be created.
If the key is created, its string will be set to &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Add to a Value</strong><br>
This action adds a number to the value at the specified key. If
the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Subtract from a Value</strong><br>
This action subtracts a number from the value at the specified
key. If the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Multiply a Value</strong><br>
This action multiplies the value at the specified key by a number.
If the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Divide a Value</strong><br>
This action divides the value at the specified key by a number.
If the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Modulus a Value</strong><br>
This action modulus the value at the specified key by a number.
If the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Operate on a Value<br>
</strong>This action performs the specified operation on value at
the specified key using the specified number as the second
operand. If the key does not exist, an error (code 6) is
generated. Acceptable operations are + (addition), - (subtraction),
* (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulus). Any other
operation will reuslt in an error (code 12) being generated. Note:
Only the first character of the operation string is looked at.</p>

<p><strong>Modify/Add a String</strong><br>
This action will change the string at the specified key to the
specified string. If the key does not exist, it will be created.
If the key is created, its value will be set to 0.</p>

<p><strong>Modify/Add a Value at an Address</strong><br>
This action will change the value at the specified address to the
specified value. If the address is bad (that is, 0), it will
generate an error (code 5).</p>

<p><strong>Modify/Add a String</strong> <strong>at an Address</strong><br>
This action will change the string at the specified address to
the specified string. If the address is bad (that is, 0), it will
generate an error (code 5).</p>

<p><strong>Delete a Key</strong><br>
This action deletes the specified key. If the key is not found,
this action returns an error (code 6).</p>

<p><strong>Clear the Array</strong><br>
This actions deletes all of the keys from the array.</p>

<p><strong>Crop with Respect to the Start of Keys</strong><br>
This action removes keys from the array. If Include is 0, keys
starting with the given substring are removed from the array. If
Include is 1, keys starting with the given substring are included
(or left) in the array while every other key is removed.</p>

<p><strong>Crop with Respect to the End of Keys</strong><br>
This action removes keys from the array. If Include is 0, keys
ending with the given substring are removed from the array. If
Include is 1, keys ending with the given substring are included (or
left) in the array while every other key is removed.</p>

<p><strong>Crop with Respect to the Contents of Keys</strong><br>
This action removes keys from the array. If Include is 0, keys
containing the given substring are removed from the array. If
Include is 1, keys containing the given substring are included (or
left) in the array while every other key is removed.</p>

<p><strong>Copy All Keys</strong><br>
This action copies all of the keys of the array with the
specified array address to the array.</p>

<p><strong>Copy with Respect to the Start of Keys</strong><br>
This action copies keys of the array with the specified array
address to the array. If Include is 1, keys starting with the
given substring are copied from the array. If Include is 0, keys
starting with the given substring are not copied from the array.</p>

<p><strong>Copy with Respect to the End of Keys</strong><br>
This action copies keys of the array with the specified array
address to the array. If Include is 1, keys ending with the given
substring are copied from the array. If Include is 0, keys ending
with the given substring are not copied from the array.</p>

<p><strong>Copy with Respect to the Contents of Keys<br>
</strong>This action copies keys of the array with the specified
array address to the array. If Include is 1, keys containing the
given substring are copied from the array. If Include is 0, keys
containing the given substring are not copied from the array.</p>

<p><strong>Set File Loading Interval</strong><br>
This action sets the interval (in millisecond) at which the
object will temporarily stop loading a file and allow MMF to
execute one program loop. If the interval is 0, the entire file
will be loaded all at once. If the interval is not 0, the file
will not start being loaded until the end of the current MMF loop.</p>

<p><strong>Set to Load Entire File All at Once</strong><br>
This action sets the loading interval to 0 so that the entire
file will be loaded all at once.</p>

<p><strong>Set File Saving Progress Update Interval</strong><br>
This action sets the interval (in millisecond) at which the
object will temporarily stop saving a file and allow MMF to
execute one program loop. If the interval is 0, the entire file
will be saved all at once. If the interval is not 0, the file
will not start being saved until the end of the current MMF loop.</p>

<p><strong>Set to Save Entire File All at Once<br>
</strong>This action sets the saving interval to 0 so that the
entire file will be saved all at once.</p>

<p><strong>Set Encryption Key</strong><br>
This action sets the encryption key to be used with the Load/Save
Encrypted Array File actions. You must set the key before using
those functions. The key may be a maximum of 56 characters.
Anything longer will be truncated to 56 characters.</p>

<p><strong>Load an Encrypted Associative Array File</strong><br>
This actions loads an Encrypted Array File using the current
encryption key and using the specified Method number. If you
attempt to load an array using the wrong key, an error will be
generated. Using a wrong method will simply load gibberish.</p>

<p><strong>Save an Encrypted Associative Array File<br>
</strong>This actions saves an Encrypted Array File using the
current encryption key and using the specified Method number. If
you attempt to save an array before setting the key, an error
will be generated. The Method number provides slightly more
encryption just as it does for normal array files.</p>

<p><strong>Load an Associative Array File</strong><br>
This actions loads in a file saved with the 'Save an Associatve
Array File' action. In order to successfully load an Associatve
Array File, you must use the Method number used when saving the
file. Otherwise, you will just load in useless gibberish.</p>

<p><strong>Save an Associative Array File</strong><br>
This action saves an encrypted file containing all of the data (both
strings and values) stored in the array. The Method number
determines how the file will be encrypted (using 0 will leave the
file unencrypted). You will need to use the same Method number
you use here in order to load the Associatve Array File later, so
don't forget it!</p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Strings</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item in loaded as a key, and the item's
string is stored as a string at the key. Groups are ignored in
this action.</p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Strings and Keep Group Info</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item is loaded as key in this format: <font
color="#FF0000">groupname</font><font color="#000000">delimiter</font><font
color="#0000FF">itemname</font><font color="#000000">. The item's
string is stored as a string at the key.</font></p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Values</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item in loaded as a key, and the item's
string is converted stored as a value at the key. Groups are
ignored in this action.</p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Values and Keep Group Info</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item is loaded as key in this format: <font
color="#FF0000">groupname</font><font color="#000000">delimiter</font><font
color="#0000FF">itemname</font><font color="#000000">. The item's
string is converted and stored as a value at the key.</font></p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Strings and into Values</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item in loaded as a key, and the item's
string is stored as a string and as a value at the key. Groups
are ignored in this action.</p>

<p><strong>Load an INI into Strings and into Values and Keep
Group Info</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the data from the
specified INI file. Each item is loaded as key in this format: <font
color="#FF0000">groupname</font><font color="#000000">delimiter</font><font

string is stored as a string and as a value at the key.</font></p>

<p><strong>Save an INI from Strings</strong><br>
This action saves the data in the array to the specified file. It
stores data in this format: <font color="#FF0000">key</font><font
color="#000000">=</font><font color="#0000FF">string</font><font
color="#000000">. This action will not save the values stored at
keys.</font></p>

<p><strong>Save an INI from Strings and Keep Group Info<br>
</strong>This action saves the data in the array to the specified
file. It uses the delimiter to separate group names and item
names for the INI. For example, if the delimiter is set to &quot;|++|&quot;
and if the current key is &quot;gargle|++|cramped&quot;, this
action will put <font color="#FF0000">cramped</font><font
color="#000000">=</font><font color="#0000FF">string </font>under
group <font color="#FF0000">gargle </font>in the INI file. <font
color="#000000">This action will not save the values stored at

action will put <font color="#FF0000">cramped</font><font
color="#000000">=</font><font color="#0000FF">string or value </font>under
group <font color="#FF0000">gargle </font>in the INI file. <font
color="#000000">This action will save the string stored at a key
so long as the string is <em>not</em> equal to the exclusion
string. If it is equal to the exclusion string, the action will
save the value stored at the key instead.</font></p>

<p><strong>Save an INI from Values with Exclusion</strong><br>
This action saves the data in the array to the specified file. It
stores data in this format: <font color="#FF0000">key</font><font
color="#000000">=</font><font color="#0000FF">string or value</font><font
color="#000000">. This action will save the value stored at a key
so long as the value is <em>not</em> equal to the exclusion value.
If it is equal to the exclusion value, the action will save the
string stored at the key instead.</font></p>

<p><strong>Save an INI from Values with Exclusion and Keep Group
Info<br>
</strong>This action saves the data in the array to the specified
file. It uses the delimiter to separate group names and item
names for the INI. For example, if the delimiter is set to &quot;|++|&quot;
and if the current key is &quot;gargle|++|cramped&quot;, this
action will put <font color="#FF0000">cramped</font><font
color="#000000">=</font><font color="#0000FF">string or value </font>under
group <font color="#FF0000">gargle </font>in the INI file. <font
color="#000000">This action will save the value stored at a key
so long as the value is <em>not</em> equal to the exclusion value.
If it is equal to the exclusion value, the action will save the
string stored at the key instead.</font></p>

<p><strong>Load a List File</strong><br>
This action clears the array and loads the specified list file,
which is file containing a list of elements separated by line
breaks. Each element in the list is loaded as key with a string
of &quot;&quot; and a value of 0.</p>

<p><strong>Save a List File<br>
</strong>This action saves the data in the array to the specified
file. The keys are saved as a list with elements separated by
line breaks. Strings and values are not saved.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Expression Error Code</strong><br>
This action clears the expression error code, setting it to 0.</p>
