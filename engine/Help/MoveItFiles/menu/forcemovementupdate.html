<h2>Force movement update</h2>
<hr>

Normally MoveIt controls all the movement automaticly by updating the movement of all objects every event cycle. This event forces MoveIt to update the positions of the controlled objects. <br />
Each time you trigger this action, it will simulate that one event cycle has passed so you can actually use this as some sort of alternative for the Move Safely Object but this then supports multiple objects but might not be as accurate as the Move Safely object.
