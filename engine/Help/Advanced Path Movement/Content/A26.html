<p>This is the most common action to use when handling journey control. This 
will find the best possible path to take if the player, from their LAST point in 
the journey, want to venture off to another node. If your creating a 'point and 
click' game, then you should use 'Clear Journey' with parameter 1 before calling 
this command, because if the user clicks while the player is walking, then the 
player will continue to complete their old path until they reach the end and 
will then continue on to their new path. </p>
<p>REALLY IMPORTANT! You must set a start position for your object. Use the 'Add 
node to journey' to set the players first co-ordinate if you haven't done 
anything else already. The find path action wont work if it doesn't know where 
the player has to start. </p>
