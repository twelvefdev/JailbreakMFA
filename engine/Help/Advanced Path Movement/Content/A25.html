<p>This action clears all instructions for the journey. However, you have an 
option. </p>
<p>If you enter 0, then the entire Journey array is cleared, including the 
current node. This means your player will be lost. You should use this journey 
if your killing a player or something, and you dont intend them to move again</p>
<p>If you enter 1, then the Journey is 'cut short'. This means that if your 
player is between two nodes and the action is called, then the player will keep 
walking until they reach a node and will then stop. You should use this action 
if your player is following the path and you suddenly want to change coarse and 
walk on another journey. </p>
