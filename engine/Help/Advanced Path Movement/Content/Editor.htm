<p>The Path Maker is a special little program that has a similar interface to 
the MMF path editor. The editor allows you to edit and create paths, and save 
them for use in the Advanced Path Movement Object.</p>

<p>Right click near a node to bring up a popup menu. You will first have to 
select 'Position' so the 'car' knows where it starts. Then move the mouse to 
another node, and bring up the menu and select 'Find Path'. The car will 
determine the best way to get there. If the car doesn't start moving, then there 
is no possible path to the node. </p>

<p>Clicking this button will bring up a special wizard that will allow you to 
'capture' a screenshot of your playfield. Follow the instructions. When 
finished, a slightly transparent screenshot will appear in your background and 
you can use it as a guide. </p>
