<h3>What is the Particle Spray Object?</h3>
The Particle Spray extension is a Particle Simulator.
By manipulating its setup values you can create an unlimited number of effects.
Fire, Explosions, Paint Spray, Water, Rain, Snow...
<br><br><br><hr>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
The Particle Spray extension was designed to give the user as much space as possible to implement his own ideas, but still keeping a user-friendly working interface.
You can choose to either let the extension do everything automatically for you (positioning all objects, changing their opacity/direction) or to do these things yourself to adjust it to your own taste.
No matter which of these methods you choose you will have to give the extension a few settings to work with. These will be used to calculate the physics of your particles.
The extension doesn't automatically display the particles. Check out the examples that came with this file to learn how to make your particle simulation visible

<h3>Sprayers, Particles & Magnets</h3>
These three object types are what you will work with. You can have unlimited of each kind.

<h4>Sprayers:</h4>
The Sprayer is the object that creates your Particle. Every Sprayer has his unique ID number which you will use to get access to it's information.
After the particles have been created they actually still stay in their Sprayer. It is only their "physical" part that is outside the Sprayer.

<h4>Particles:</h4>
All Particles have been created in a Sprayer, to make the access to the particles easy they all have a parent ID that is the same as the ID of the Sprayer that has created them.
All Particles also have an Index number. These two numbers make every single particle unique.

<h4>Magnets:</h4>
Magnets are used to attract/detract particles. Every Magnet is represented with it's unique ID number.

<h3>The Editor</h3>

<font style='font-size:10pt;'>
In the editor you can create a set of pre-defined sprayers. Use the editor if you don't want to make all setting using events in the event editor.<br>
All settings you make here will be used at run-time.<br><br>
Write the name for your sprayer preset in the editbox at the top-left and press <b>New Sprayer Preset</b> to add a new preset.<br>
This preset gets a sprayer ID which will be used to identify the preset at runtime.<br>
E.g if your preset called 'Fire' has the ID number 4, all settings you make to that preset will get loaded into Sprayer Slot 4.<br><br>
You can save and load all your current presets to/from files using the <b>Import</b> and <b>Export</b> buttons.<br><br>
Use the <b>Delete</b> button to remove the currently selected preset.<br><br>
Pressing <b>Ok</b> will close the editor and save all changes.<br>
Pressing <b>Cancel</b> will close the editor but will not save the changes you have made.
