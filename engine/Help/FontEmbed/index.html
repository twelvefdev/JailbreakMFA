<h1>Font Embed Object</h1>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>This extension object is super-straightforward, so if you have any problems not covered in this documentation, then you should consider yourself unworthy of human contact and go live as a hermit. Go on; go!</p>

<p>Otherwise, read below.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <em>Font Embed Object</em> registers non-local fonts to your application using the Windows API function <code>AddFontResourceExA</code>, found in GDI32.dll.</p>
<p>This enables you to bundle a font with your application and use it without installing the font on the target user's computer. The font will remain private to your application only, so programs like MS Word will be unable to access your font, even if your application is running at the time.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>There are no conditions. So there. That was simple wasn't it?</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<table border="1px" style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Action</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Embed Font</td>
		<td>Registers the font. Write the full path to the font on the hard disk when prompted. You can register multiple fonts at the same time by separating them with a single | pipe character. If you have embedded a font file into your project as a Binary, you'll need to extract it and use the BinFileTempName$() function to locate it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Remove Font</td>
		<td>This removes the font. This must contain the same path that you used in the Embed action.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Expressions</h3>
<table border="1px" style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Expression</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Number of fonts added<br />
			E.g.<br />
			FontsAdded( str ObjectName )
			</td>
		<td>Returns the number of fonts registered by the last call Embed action. If 0, then the embed failed.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
