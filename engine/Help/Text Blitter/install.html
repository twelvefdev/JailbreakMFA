<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Depending on what distribution you have acquired depends on the type of installation required</p>

<p>Most distributions will come in the form of a self extracting exe file (with no un-installer). You can run the installer and everything will be installed into the correct locations. However, if you have obtained the extension in the form of a zip file, you will be required to manually copy the extension to the MMF extension directory.</p>

<p>To install the edit-time version of the extension, copy 'txtblt.cox' from the /bin/ directory to 'c:/imsi/mmfusion/programs/extensions/'. You must also copy the optimised and smaller 'txtblt.cox' from the runtime folder to 'c:/imsi/mmfusion/programs/data/runtime'. Once complete the extension should be installed correctly. Please note, the exact directory location may be slightly different on your computer</p>

<p>To uninstall the extension simply remove those two files. You are also required to remove them in this method if you downloaded the self extracting installer</p>

<p>If you are unsure of the directory structure, here is a map and where everything should go</p>
