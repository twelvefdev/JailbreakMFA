<h2>Dialog Reference</h2>
<h4>The Character Map Creation Dialog</h4>
<p><img src="img/generate.gif" align="right">

<p>I realise that creating a character map from scratch, using a simple paint program, is a very difficult task. As a benefit to users, I have created a fast and effective way to accomplish this. The Font Generator is designed to allow you to create your own bitmap fonts from fonts on your system.</p>

<p>The Font Generator utility is a little primitive, but it includes several features. Special features, such as "outline" and "shadow" can automatically make your bitmap text more attractive.</p>

<p>This utility is not intended as the primary means to create your bitmaps. While it allows you to create bitmaps from fonts on the fly, it is really more useful as a way to create a template that can then be modified or enhanced externally with your favourite graphics tools.</p>

<p>The Internet contains many pre-built font bitmaps that you can download at the touch of a button. You can also create your own from image dumps from emulators, to get the effect console games used many eons ago.</p>

<p><font color="red">[ WARNING: The character generator will remove your balloon image after generation... Make sure you backup or save your balloon data before generating a new font ]</font></p>

<p><b>Main</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Preview Window</b> - Shows what the image will look like when it is created</li>
<li><b>Update</b> - Update the image using the current options</li>
<li><b>Export</b> - Export the image displayed in the preview window, obviously all of the image will be exported not just the bit you can see. You will be asked whether you wish to update the bitmap before you are asked for a filename. Updating the image is basically the same as clicking on the 'Update' button.
</ul>

<p><b>Character Setup</b></p>

<p>The image options give you general control over properties of the internal image</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Preview Window</b> - Displays a preview of the options currently selected, font, font colour, background colour etc.</li>
<li><b>Font</b> - Select the font you wish to use</li>
<li><b>Font Colour</b> - Select the colour of the font you wish to use</li>
<li><b>Background</b> - Select the background colour of the bitmap</li>
<li><b>Char Size</b> - Choose the size of the grid to place your characters</li>
<li><b>Character Set</b> - Set the order of the characters you wish to appear on the map</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Effect</b></p>

<p>Using just a standard font can look fairly boring, the extra options allow you to spice your text up a little giving it different effects.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>None</b> - No Effect should be used</li>
<li><b>Shadow</b> - Shadow effect should be used</li>
<li><b>Outline</b> - Outline Effect should be used</li>
<li><b>Offset</b> - For the shadow, this is the offset of the shadow, for the outline option, this is the width of the outline colour</li>
<li><b>Colour</b> - The colour to use in the effect</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Options</b></p>

<p>Some standard options</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Transparent Background</b> - Uses black (0,0,0) as the background colour, which is displayed as transparent</li>
<li><i><b>Centre Font</b> - Centres the font within each grid cell</i> <font color="red">[ Not yet available ] </font></li>

</ul>
