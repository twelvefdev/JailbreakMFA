<h2>Using the Extension</h2>

<p>If you are unsure of how to get started using the extension, follow the steps outlined below. There is also information covering what the different dialog boxes do and what effect they have on the rest of the extension.</p>

<h4>Inserting the Extension</h4>
<p><img src="./img/insert.gif" align="left">
To insert the extension into your frame, make sure you are looking at the frame editor. Then select 'New Object Into Frame' ( or 'Insert Object' depending on your version of Multimedia Fusion) from the 'Insert' popup on the main Multimedia Fusion menu bar. You will be presented with a dialog similar to the one shown to the left. Scroll down the list until you find the Text Blitter. Select the Text Blitter Extension and then click Ok.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot find the extension, please make sure you have followed the installation steps correctly. Check back to the <a href="./install.html">installation page</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
After you select it, you will be given a cross-hair you use to place the object. Just click once to place it. After placing the object you will be presented with an About box which outlines the terms on which you can use the product.

Once inserted, you should see something that looks like the image shown to the right. To alter the extension, either double click or right click and select 'Edit'
</p>

<p>
If you are using Multimedia Fusion version 1.5 or above, you will be able to take advantage of some of the items located on the 'Text' menu within the frame editor. The new version of the extension allows you to alter the alignment quickly and easily through this menu.
