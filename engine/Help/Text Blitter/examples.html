<p>Welcome to the examples section, below are references to the examples that come with text blitter</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td>
Original examples
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex1.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>01 - Animation Example</b> - basic</p><p>Not sure what parameters to use for the 'Cos Scroller' animation, well, this simple example allows you to play around with the settings <b>at runtime</b> and see the result live. As a task, you could convert the example into a full featured animation previewer that allows you to select the different animations and alter the parameters of each.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex2.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>02 - Character Map Example </b> - basic</p><p>In the event that a bitmap doesn't follow a standard order, this example shows you how to set up the extension in a way that allows you to use it.</p><p>This example does not include any events</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex3.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>03 - Scrolling Credits </b> - basic</p><p>Again, another very basic example showing you how easy it is to put together a simple demo without even using any events.</p><p>The scrolling is handled by the object using the parameters defined in the setup dialog. The example also demonstrates the vertical fade effect on marquee animations</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex4.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>04 - Automatic Scrolling </b> - Intermediate</p><p>Another friarly simple example shows how you can create an automatic scrolling engine, maybe for an RPG style text box. (Check further down for a true typing engine). The example allows you to type text into the exit box which is then copied to the Text Blitter, through a couple of events the extension will scroll until the last line of text is most visible.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex5.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>05 - Flag Example </b> - basic</p><p>Again, no events here, all the work is handled by the extension. This example shows you how to construct a simple waving flag using the 'Sin Wave' animation. The rest of the example is just backdrop objects which make the effect appear more real.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex6.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>06 - Animation Emulator</b> - Intermediate</p><p>Using different options this time (see the other Animation example below) this example provides the same effect. The effect is the same, however, in my opinion is easier to create</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex7.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>07 - Scrolling Credits </b> - basic</p><p>Another scrolling credits example with a different bitmap this time. This example doesn't include any events</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex8.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>08 - Scrolling RPG Text</b> - Intermediate</p><p>Something on the borderline of advanced, this example shows you how to create a simple scrolling typing engine. The vertical fade effect ensures the text is smoothly created and moved off the screen. This is a never before seen effect in multimedia fusion!!</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex9.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>09 - Animation Emulator </b> - Advanced</p><p>This example includes two frames, the first shows how to do a simple animation effect cycling through different pictures on a bitmap. The second frame plays the same animation forwards and backwards in a repetitive loop</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex10.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>10 - Active Object Emulator </b> - Advanced</p><p>Although the principle of this example is fairly simple, its quite an advanced technique and something which you will find extremely interesting. The example shows how to emulate an active object with animations and directions. The image could also be stored externally allowing users to customise your game</p>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Balloon examples
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex11.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>11 - Balloons </b> - Intermediate</p><p>Using a simple script engine, this example uses the balloon effects within the text blitter to create a speach-engine between two players.</p>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Callback examples
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex12.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>12 - Callback - Trails </b> - Intermediate</p><p>Using the list controls, this example creates a simple mouse trail effect</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex13.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>13 - Callback - Rotating </b> - Intermediate</p><p>In this example, the text rotates around </p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex14.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>14 - Callback - Blitting </b> - Advanced</p><p>A simple way of blitting different sized 'sprites' to the screen.</p>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex15.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>15 - Callback - Alternate Lines </b> - Intermediate</p><p>The callback routine changes the image offset every even line. There are 2 character-maps stored on the internal image, one lighter than the other.</p>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="img/ex16.gif" align="left"></td>
<td valign="top"><p><b>16 - Callback - Real-time-lighting </b> - Advanced</p><p>Using the transparency options with the callback routines, this example shows you how you can create a nice looking real-time-lighting engine over the text<br><b>Requires Cursor Object</b></p>
