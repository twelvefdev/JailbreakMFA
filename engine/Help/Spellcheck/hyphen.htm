<div class="title">Hypthen Modes</div>

Some words are joined together using hyphens. The rules for which words can and cannot be joined together are complex and often broken in everyday English. Because of this, the spellchecker offers two modes for dealing with them.<br><Br>

First you can force every hyphenated word to be in the wordlist. This would require a very big wordlist however!<br><Br>

The second (and recommended) way is to allow hyphenated words so long as each sub-word is in the wordlist.
