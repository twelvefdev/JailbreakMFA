<h2>Mark all connected as used</h2>
<hr>

This is very similar to the manual way of <a href="markbrickused.html">marking bricks</a>.

Instead this action automaticly marks all bricks AGBO finds when a "On found connected is" condition is triggered. This is just a shortcut to mark all bricks instead of having to loop through all the bricks and manually mark each of them as used. This action does it for you.
