<h2>Delete horizontal line</h2>
<hr>

This action takes a Y coordinate. It then deletes all bricks in the horizontal line where the Y coordinate is equal the line of your choice. The next parameter takes a value. If you leave it as 0, the line will simply be deleted and nothing more will happen. If you enter '1' as the value, all bricks to the left of the line, will be moved one slot to the right. If you enter '2', all lines to the right are moved one slot to the left.

All bricks moved will trigger a "On brick moved" condition and all deleted bricks in the line will trigger a "On brick deleted" condition.
