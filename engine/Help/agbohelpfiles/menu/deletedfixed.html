<h2>On deleted brick: Get fixed value of brick</h2>
<hr>
If you have the "Trigger deleted bricks" option turned ON, AGBO will trigger an "On deleted brick" condition.
<br /><br />
In that event, you can get the fixed value of the brick that was deleted. This is useful if you want to pick out the the active object that was deleted in AGBO so you can delete the correct object.
