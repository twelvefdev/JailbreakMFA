<h2>On looped brick</h2>
<hr>

This event is triggered for each brick AGBO finds when you do some extra looping functions from the "Extra looping" submenu. This could for example be all bricks in a vertical line or all bricks around a given brick.
<br />
When this condition is triggered, you can get the current X, Y, brick type and sotred fixed value of the currently enumerated brick, though the expressions in the "On looped brick" submenu.
<br /><br />

<div class="event">On looped brick</div>

<br />
Works like a fastloop condition.
