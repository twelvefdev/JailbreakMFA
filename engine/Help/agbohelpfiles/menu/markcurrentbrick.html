<h2>Mark brick as used</h2>
<hr>

This is very similar to the manual way of <a href="markbrickused.html">marking bricks</a>.

Instead this action is only used when you <a href="loopfoundbricks.html">"Loop though found bricks"</a>. When the condition "On found brick" is triggered, you can then mark the currently looped brick. This is just a shortcut to mark that brick instead of having to enter X and Y coordinate of the brick. This action doesn't take any paramters.
