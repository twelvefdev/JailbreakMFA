<h2>On found brick</h2>
<hr>

This event is triggered for each brick found in the current system, if you used the action "Loop through found bricks" in the "On found connected" condition.
<br />
When this condition is triggered, you can get the current X, Y, brick type and sotred fixed value of the currently enumerated brick, though the expressions in the "On found brick" submenu.
<br /><br />

<div class="event">On found brick</div>

<br />
Works like a fastloop condition.
