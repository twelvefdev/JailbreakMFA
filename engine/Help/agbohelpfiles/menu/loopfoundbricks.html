<h2>Loop through found bricks</h2>
<hr>

When AGBO finds connected bricks from one of the search features, it triggers the "On found connected" condition. You can then make AGO loop through all theese bricks for you and give you information about each brick. If you use this action, AGBO will trigger this condition:
<div class="event"> On found brick</div>
for each brick it found.

<br /><br />

When that condition is triggered, you can get information about the found brick through expressions from the "On found brick" submenu.
