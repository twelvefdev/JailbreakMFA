<h2>Loop all bricks of type</h2>
<hr>

This action is similar to the "Loop all bricks in board" but it will only trigger "On looped brick" when it finds a brick of the given type.
<br />
<br />
<b>Parameters:</b><br />
Bricktype - the type of brick AGBO will look for in the board
<br />
<br />

When you start a loop, its like starting a fastloop. AGBO will trigger a condition similar to an "on loop" condition for each brick that you told AGBO to loop through.
<div class="event">On looped brick</div>
