<h2>On moved brick: Get fixed value of brick</h2>
<hr>
If you have the "Trigger moved bricks" option turned ON, AGBO will trigger an "On moved brick" condition.
<br /><br />
In that event, you can get the fixed value of the brick that was moved. This is useful if you want to pick out the the active object that was moved in AGBO so you can reposition the active object in the MMF window.
