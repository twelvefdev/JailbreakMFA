<h2>Insert brick</h2>
<hr>

This action inserts a brick into the board. This action is a bit special. IF you insert a brick at a given location, the brick type will then be at that position and the other bricks will be moved one space to the right to make space for the new brick. The fun thing about this action is that if you have multiple lines, the bricks from the right edge of the board, will be moved down to the next line to the left. If a brick is moved completely out of the board, it will trigger a "On brick deleted" condition.
