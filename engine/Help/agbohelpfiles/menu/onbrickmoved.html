<h2>On brick moved</h2>
<hr>

This event is triggered when you did any actions that caused ABGO to move any of the bricks. AGBO will then start a fast loop alike loop that tells you exactly which bricks moved, what their old X and Y coordinates were, and also the the new coordinates and their fixed values stored into them.
<br />
Note! This condition only triggers if you turned the option ON in the setup box.
