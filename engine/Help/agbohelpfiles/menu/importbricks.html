<h2>Import bricks</h2>
<hr>
If you followed the main tutorial you might have an idea on how to use this action. In short, you can with this action "import" a board of active objects into AGBO. AGBO then stores all the fixed values of the object you selected into the board so you can easier link to the board later. See exmaple files to see how this works.
