         ***     SPECIAL FUNCTIONS     ***
         *********************************


Some functions are particular, maybe they need some explanations:



INSTALLED OS:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Retrieve a value that corresponds to the version of your Windows:
          1= Windows 3.51
          2= Windows 4.0
          3= Windows 95
          4= Windows 98
          5= Windows Me
          6= Windows 2000
          7= Windows XP
          8= Windows Server 2003 Family



CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOR OF THE DESKTOP:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   The background color will only be visible if there is no wallpaper above !! To disable-it, do "Change wallpaper", choose "Expression" then keep the field empty ("").



FONT SMOOTHING:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   This function enable/disable Windows' smoothing. Of course,  the smoothing works with MMF too; but if you change the smoothing parameters, you need to restart your application.



MUSIC WITH THE INTERNAL SPEAKER:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   There is a function in the expression that retrieves for
you the frequency of the 12 musical notes of an octave.
You can use it with the BEEP function to make a melody.
When the speaker is beeping, the application is paused,
I haven't found a way to prevent that.
The BEEP works only with Windows XP.



OBTAIN THE CPU SPEED:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   It uses an ASM code that calculate in real-time the
processor speed, this function is quite slow, it's why you must
NOT use it in a condition that repeats often (ex: Always, every 0,05 s...).



OPEN A WEBSITE:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   The file will be opened with the default program associated.
If you specify a website, it will be loaded into the default browser.



CHANGE SYSTEM COLOURS:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   There are a lot of parameters for the system colours, it's why i've
took them into one. You choose which parameter to modify by entering
a number between 0 and 25; they correspond to:

     0 = COLOR_3DDKSHADOW
     1 = COLOR_3DFACE
     2 = COLOR_BTNFACE
     3 = COLOR_3DHILIGHT
     4 = COLOR_3DLIGHT
     5 = COLOR_3DSHADOW
     6 = COLOR_ACTIVEBORDER
