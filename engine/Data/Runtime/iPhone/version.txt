Fusion 2.5 iOS Runtime Build 281.8 - June 30th 2014
Copyright (c) Clickteam 2014

Changes in this version:
------------------------


- Fixed crash in iOS store object

- Fixed “Destroy if too far from frame area” option kill-zone

- Fixed fast loops being triggered twice if the frame had a fade-in transition

- Fixed multiple touch crash if touching the screen many times during a transition
- Fixed backdrops on the bottom layer not showing up in a transition if a scroll event was used at the start of the frame

- Fixed compiler issues on pre-iOS7 SDK’s (GameController)

- Fixed crash in physics system

- Added missing numeric version of Easing object ‘Move object’ action


Changes in previous versions:
------------------------

-----
- Experimental: GamePad support! (Uses the basic Gamepad profile)
- Experimental: iOS object listens to 'fusion://' URL (read more below)
- Properly resetting frame layer scrolling on frame restart
- Fixed several issues regarding layers with scrolling coefficients different than 1:
  --> Fixed mouse click and mouse-over events on objects
  --> Correcting many expressions (like coordinates of action points)
- Fixed drawing semitransparent quick backdrops
- Fixed memory corruption with unicode and String Parser extension
- Fixed memory corruption when loading the renderer (rare crash)
- Fixed XCode project file referencing an absolute path
- Fixed crash when reading outside bounds in a 1-based string array object
- Fixed MOD operater on floating point values
- Fixed Active Picture rendering and scaling problems
- Made several linked frameworks optional so they only load on demand - possibly speeding up the loading of your games/apps

Until we are sure the features works as expected I will add experimental iOS features through the iOS Object's 
"Open URL" action where it will listen to 'fusion://' prefixed URLs.
Two features are currently implemented:
'fusion://dismissKeyboard' - Dismisses the keyboard globally from any control currently having the keyboard open.
'fusion://startWirelessControllerDiscovery' - Instructs iOS to manually start looking for nearby wirelss Game Controllers.

Note: While your game is connected to a GamePad the screen's idle timer is disabled.
This means that the screen will not dim and turn off after a given timeout since the player usually rarely touches the screen during gameplay when a gamepad is used.
When the GamePad is disconnected from the device the idle-timer is reverted back to the default value you set in the properties.
